# Walk Jog Run

### Walking
This mod adds a slight change to the way Minecraft movement functions. 
This mod allows players to toggle between a slower walking pace and the usual jogging state.
This is to promote slower player movement without detracting from the typical Minecraft experience.

Players can use the <kbd>TAB</kbd> key (configurable) to switch between the walking and jogging states.

The updated values for player speed can be found below:
- Player Walk Speed: 0.07 *(-.03 Usual Move-speed)*
- Player Jog Speed: 0.1 *(Normal Player Movement)*
- Player Sprint Speed: *Unaffected*

### Stamina

Sprinting is to be altered fundamentally as well. Rather than draining from your food source, 
sprinting will simply drain a secondary bar and give you a slight slowness debuff after expending 
it all the way without allowing it to recharge. The hunger that you have instead acts as the 
total cap of stamina that you can utilise, a full stomach allowing you to run for much longer 
than an empty one.
